## What is Emby Dev?

Emby.dev gives developer teams **easy and secure access to the best open-source coding models** like Kimi, DeepSeek, GLM and Qwen—without surprise token bills, proprietary lock-in, or dealing with GPU hardware, compatibility issues, and compliance.\
Use your existing tools (Cursor, Kilo, Warp, IDE plugins) with\
**drop-in OpenAI & Claude-compatible API keys**, routing to our EU-hosted models with zero setup.

Checkout our handy guides for integrating with tools like Kilo Code, Claude Code and more here.

  <Card title="Unified Model Routing">
    Use our open-source models with our unlimited subscription, and keep using
    models from OpenAI (Azure), Anthropic (AWS), Gemini (Vertex).\ \

## Problems We Solve

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Unpredictable Token Costs" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **⭕ The Problem:**\
    Using AI code editors like Cursor, Kilo Code, Claude Code and Warp becomes extremely expensive easily reaching **€100/day per developer** and scales unpredictably as AI becomes central to your daily workflow.\
    \
    Providers like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google aggressively overcharge for inference, train on your data, and lack proper EU compliance.

    **💡 Emby’s Solution:**\
    Predictable subscription pricing per developer.\
    Unlimited Emby-token usage with fair usage limits depending on your plan, starting at €60/m per seat, we never store your chats, messages, or prompts.\
    \
    We promise we'll never train on your data and for an enterprise license enable self hosting contact us at [hello@emby.ai ](mailto:hello@emby.ai)with more info your project.\

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Too many API keys" icon="key">
    **⭕ The Problem:**\
    Constantly updating API keys for different providers, new model releases, changing limits, and compliance checks create chaos in your team setup.

    **💡 Emby’s Solution:**\
    One unified API that routes to **trusted** providers like Azure (OpenAI), AWS Bedrock (Anthropic), Nebius, Vertex, DeepInfra and more.\
    \
    _Use our routing (5%) or bring your own keys (€50/month)._

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Slow Inference & Compatibility Issues" icon="zap">
    **⭕ The Problem:**\
    AI coding tools break easily when providers throttle, change APIs, move regions, or release new model versions.\
    Latency fluctuates; compatibility breaks; nothing feels consistently fast.

    **💡 Emby’s Solution:**\
    We host key models directly in the EU for **consistently fast, low-latency performance**.\
    Our API remains compatible with tools like Cursor, Kilo Code, Claude Code—even when those tools shift their integrations.\
    Integrate Emby once, and your setup stays stable.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Vendor Lock-In & Data Privacy" icon="lock">
    **⭕ The Problem:**\
    Tools like Cursor & Warp frequently change pricing, rate limits, and policies.\
    "\$20/month unlimited" becomes stricter every few months more timeouts, rate limits, more throttling, and much less value. With increasing bills every single month.

    Most of these editors route requests through OpenAI, Anthropic or OpenRouter, meaning:

    - Unpredictable token costs
    - No real EU compliance
    - Code & prompts leaving the EU
    - Paid premium models that get **brutally** expensive at team scale

    Trying to avoid this by hosting your own models forces you into GPU maintenance, scaling, networking, patches things your team does **not** want to be responsible for.

    **💡 Emby’s Solution:**\
    Predictable model access via simple per-developer pricing.\
    Fully EU-hosted. No lock-in. No surprise token bills.\
    Zero GPU management your team just uses the models they want.\
    Always the newest releases available the same day.
