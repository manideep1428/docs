DeBounce is a web service that provides an API for **email verification** and **list cleaning**. The DeBounce API allows developers to integrate email verification into their applications and websites, helping to ensure that the email addresses they collect are valid and deliverable.

The API works by taking an email address and checking it against various tools, databases, and algorithms to determine whether it is **valid**, **invalid**, or **risky**. It can detect and correct typos, syntax errors, and other issues that can cause emails to bounce or be marked as spam.

DeBounce's **enterprise-grade**, cloud-based email verification and data enrichment solution is compatible with **all programming languages**.
