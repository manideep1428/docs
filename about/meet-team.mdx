## About Emby.dev

A personal note from the Emby team.

We're building a better way to access AI models—one that's transparent, EU-first, and developer-focused. No surprise bills, no vendor lock-in, just reliable AI infrastructure that works.

## Our Story

Emby.dev was born from frustration with the current state of AI model access. As developers ourselves, we experienced:

- **Unpredictable costs** that made budgeting impossible
- **Vendor lock-in** that limited our choices
- **Complex integrations** that wasted valuable development time
- **Privacy concerns** with data leaving the EU
- **Unreliable service** during critical moments

We knew there had to be a better way.

## Our Mission

**Make AI accessible, predictable, and privacy-first for European developers.**

We believe that:

- ✅ **Pricing should be predictable** - No surprise token bills or shifting limits
- ✅ **Privacy matters** - Your data stays in the EU, and we never train on it
- ✅ **Developers deserve choice** - Access multiple providers through one API
- ✅ **Simplicity wins** - Integration should take minutes, not days
- ✅ **Compliance is essential** - ISO27001, NEN7510, and GDPR from day one

## How We're Different

We're not just another AI API gateway. We're building infrastructure that puts developers first:

### 🔒 Privacy-First Architecture

- **EU-hosted infrastructure** on ISO27001 & NEN7510 certified servers
- **No prompt storage** - We don't keep your API requests or responses
- **No training on your data** - Your code and prompts remain private
- **GDPR compliant** - Full data sovereignty and user rights

### 💰 Predictable Pricing

- **Flat per-developer pricing** - No token counting, no surprise bills
- **Unlimited usage** - Fair usage limits based on your plan
- **No hidden fees** - What you see is what you pay
- **Cancel anytime** - No long-term contracts required

### ⚡ Developer Experience

- **Drop-in compatibility** - Works with Cursor, Kilo Code, and other tools
- **OpenAI & Anthropic APIs** - Use familiar interfaces
- **Fast EU routing** - Low latency from European data centers
- **One API key** - Access all models through a single endpoint

### 🌍 European Values

- **Data sovereignty** - All data processed in the EU
- **Transparent operations** - Clear pricing, clear policies
- **Sustainable infrastructure** - Efficient, green hosting
- **Local support** - European team, European timezone

## Our Team

We're a small, dedicated team based in the Netherlands, focused on building the AI infrastructure we wish existed.

### Core Values

**Transparency** 🔍  
We believe in clear pricing, open communication, and honest business practices. No hidden fees, no surprise changes.

**Privacy** 🔒  
Your data is yours. We don't store prompts, we don't train on your data, and we keep everything in the EU.

**Reliability** ⚡  
We build infrastructure you can depend on. 99.9% uptime, fast response times, and always-available support.

**Developer-First** 💻  
Built by developers, for developers. We understand your workflow and build tools that fit seamlessly.

## Technology Stack

Our infrastructure is built on:

- **Hosting**: bit.nl (Netherlands) - ISO27001 & NEN7510 certified
- **Security**: TLS 1.3, encrypted at rest, regular security audits
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 uptime monitoring and alerting
- **Compliance**: GDPR, ISO27001, NEN7510, SOC 2 (in progress)
- **Performance**: Global CDN, edge caching, optimized routing

## Our Commitment

We commit to:

1. **Never train on your data** - Your prompts and responses are private
2. **Keep data in the EU** - No transfers outside European jurisdiction
3. **Transparent pricing** - No hidden fees or surprise charges
4. **Fast support** - Response within 24 hours, usually much faster
5. **Continuous improvement** - New models added within 24 hours of release
6. **Open communication** - Status updates, roadmap transparency
