All requests to the DeBounce API require authentication via an API key. This page explains how to obtain and use your API key.

## API Key

A DeBounce API key is a 13-character alphanumeric token unique to your account.


<Note>
The API key must be included in the query string of all requests using the `api` parameter.
</Note>

You can pass the API key by appending `&api=YOUR_API_KEY` to the request URL. This method allows authentication without custom headers.

<Warning>
Authentication is mandatory for all API requests. Requests without a valid API key will be rejected.
</Warning>

## Example Request

Here's an example using cURL:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.debounce.io/v1/?api=5ba3wcc43516dc&email=example@gmail.com'
```

To generate an API key, log in to your DeBounce account and navigate to the <Link href="https://app.debounce.io/api">API</Link> settings section.
