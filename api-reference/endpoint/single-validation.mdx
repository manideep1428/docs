title: 'Single Email Validation'
openapi: 'GET /v1/'

If you require a profile photo along with the validation results, just add `&photo=true` at the end of the API endpoint. We will bill you **0.2 extra credits** for each successful profile photo added.  

To find the full name and avatar of an email owner, you must add the `&append=true` in the validation endpoint and you will pay **2 extra credits** for each successful data enrichment.

### Important Note

If you are using this API in a sign-up form, you must consider  
`Deliverable`, `Accept-all`, and `Unknown` statuses as valid,  
so you do not miss out on new sign-ups.  

Another simple way is by checking the `send_transactional` parameter:  

If its value is `1`, the email is eligible for being a new user.
