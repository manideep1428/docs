DeBounce offers a robust API endpoint that enables users to check a domain or email address against a real-time, up-to-date list of disposable domains.  
This service is **free of charge** and provides valuable insights into the quality and validity of email addresses.  

We have enabled **CORS for all domains**, so you can call the API directly from your client-side code without extra setup or configuration.  

By offering this tool, we aim to help users:  
- Improve email marketing efforts  
- Reduce the risk of sending messages to invalid or disposable addresses  

Whether you are a developer, marketer, or business owner, our disposable domains API can enhance the effectiveness of your email campaigns.  

<Warning title="Rate Limiting">

The free disposable detector API has limitations on:  
- Number of calls per day  
- Validation speed  

For security reasons, we cannot disclose the exact thresholds.  
If you use the API appropriately and within normal usage parameters, you are unlikely to encounter these limitations.  

</Warning>
