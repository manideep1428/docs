Find the name of the owner's email address and its avatar using DeBounce data enrichment API.

## Full name + Avatar

To find the full name and avatar of an email owner, you need to use the [single validation request](/api-reference/endpoint/single-validation). To make the enrichment engine active, you must add the `&append=true` in the validation endpoint.

<Note>
**Pricing**

You will pay 2 extra credits for each successful data enrichment.
</Note>

## Avatar Only

If you require a profile photo along with the validation results, just add `&photo=true` at the end of the API endpoint.

<Note>
**Pricing**

We will bill you 0.2 extra credits for each successful profile photo added.
