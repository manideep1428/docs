n8n is a powerful workflow automation tool that enables you to automate tasks and connect different services together. By integrating Emby with n8n, you can leverage AI capabilities in your automated workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An [Emby API key](https://dev.emby.ai/keys)
- Access to an n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- Basic familiarity with creating n8n workflows

## Integration Guide

Emby can be seamlessly integrated into n8n using the OpenAI node with custom configuration. Follow the steps below to set up the integration.

<Steps>

<Step>
### Create OpenAI Credentials

First, you need to create credentials for connecting to Emby's API.

1. In your n8n instance, navigate to **Settings** → **Credentials**
2. Click on **Add Credential** to create a new credential

3. Search for and select **OpenAI** from the list of available credentials

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Emby Connection

Now you'll configure the OpenAI credential to point to Emby's API endpoint.

Fill in the following fields:

- **Credential Name**: Give it a descriptive name like "Emby AI"
- **API Key**: Paste your [Emby API key](https://dev.emby.ai/keys)
- **Base URL**: Enter `https://dev.emby.ai/v1`
- **Organization ID**: Leave this field blank

Click **Save** to store your credentials.

</Step>

<Step>
### Use Emby in Your Workflow

Now you can add AI capabilities to your n8n workflows using Emby.

1. Create a new workflow or open an existing one
2. Add an **OpenAI Chat Model** node or **AI Agent** node to your workflow
3. Select the Emby credentials you just created
4. Choose a model from [Emby's model catalog](https://dev.emby.ai/models)

<Callout type="info">
  **Popular models to try:** - `gpt-5` - OpenAI's GPT-5 model -
  `claude-4.5-sonnet` - Anthropic's Claude 4.5 Sonnet - `gemini-3.0-flash` -
  Google's Gemini 3.0 Flash
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** If you're using the OpenAI node, make sure to disable the "Use
  Responses API" option, as Emby does not currently support this feature.
</Callout>

5. Configure additional parameters as needed (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
6. Connect the node to your workflow logic

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Test your workflow to ensure everything is working correctly.

1. Add a test input to your workflow (e.g., a manual trigger with a sample prompt)
2. Execute the workflow
3. Verify that you receive responses from the Emby AI model
4. Check the execution logs if you encounter any issues

<Callout type="success">
  **Success!** You've successfully integrated Emby with n8n. You can now build
  powerful AI-driven automation workflows.
</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>
