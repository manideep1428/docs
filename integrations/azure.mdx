Azure provides access to OpenAI's powerful language models through Microsoft's enterprise cloud infrastructure. This guide shows how to create an Azure resource, deploy models, and integrate them with Emby.

<Callout type="info">
  Only OpenAI models are supported via Azure at this time.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription
- Emby account (Pro plan required for provider keys) or self-hosted instance (free)

## Overview

Azure provides enterprise-grade access to OpenAI models with enhanced security, compliance, and regional availability. Emby integrates seamlessly with Azure deployments.

## Create Azure Resource

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create an Azure OpenAI Resource

1. Log into the **Azure Portal** (https://portal.azure.com)
2. Click **Create a resource**
3. Search for **Azure OpenAI** and select it
4. Click **Create**
5. Configure the resource:
   - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription
   - **Resource group**: Create new or select existing
   - **Region**: Choose a region (e.g., East US, West Europe)
   - **Name**: Enter a unique resource name (this will be your `<resource-name>`)
   - **Pricing tier**: Select Standard S0
6. Click **Review + create**, then **Create**
7. Wait for deployment to complete

**Important**: Note your resource name - it will be used in the base URL: `https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com`

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy Models

1. Navigate to your Azure resource in the Azure Portal
2. Click **Go to Azure OpenAI Studio** or visit https://oai.azure.com
3. In Azure Studio, select **Deployments** from the left sidebar
4. Click **Create new deployment**
5. Configure your deployment:
   - **Model**: Select a model (e.g., gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-4-turbo)
   - **Deployment name**: Enter a name (this must match the model identifier you'll use – use the pre-filled name)
   - **Model version**: Select the latest version
   - **Deployment type**: Global Standard
6. Click **Create**
7. Repeat for additional models you want to use

**Note**: The deployment name must match the expected model name:

- For `gpt-5-mini` → deployment name should be `gpt-5-mini`
- For `gpt-5` → deployment name should be `gpt-5`
  etc.

</Step>

<Step>
### Get API Key

1. In the Azure Portal, go to your Azure resource
2. Click **Keys and Endpoint** in the left sidebar
3. Copy **Key 1** or **Key 2**
4. Note your **Endpoint** URL (should be `https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com`)

**Important**: Keep your API key secure - it provides access to your Azure deployments.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Add to Emby

<Steps>
<Step>
### Navigate to Provider Keys

1. Log into [Emby Dashboard](https://dev.emby.ai/home)
2. Select your organization and project
3. Go to **Provider Keys** in the sidebar

</Step>

<Step>
### Add Azure Provider Key

1. Click **Add** for **Azure**
2. Enter your **API Key** from Azure Portal
3. Enter your **Resource Name** (the name from your Azure endpoint URL)
   - Example: If your endpoint is `https://my-openai-resource.openai.azure.com`, enter `my-openai-resource`
4. Select your preferred **type** (Azure OpenAI or AI Foundry)
5. Adapt the **Validation Model** to a model that you already deployed and is available
   This is a one time check to ensure the API key is valid and the model can be accessed.
6. Click **Add Key**

The system will validate your key and confirm the connection.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Test your integration with a simple API call:

```bash
curl -X POST https://dev.emby.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer EMBY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "azure/gpt-5-mini",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello from Azure!"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Replace `EMBY_API_KEY` with your Emby API key.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Available Models

Once configured, you can access your Azure deployments through Emby:

- **GPT-5**: `azure/gpt-5`
- **GPT-5 Mini**: `azure/gpt-5-mini`
- **GPT-4o**: `azure/gpt-4o`
- **GPT-4o Mini**: `azure/gpt-4o-mini`

**Note**: Only models you have deployed in Azure Studio will be available. Ensure your deployment names match the expected model identifiers.

Browse all available models at [emby.ai/models](https://emby.ai/models?provider=azure)

## Troubleshooting

### "Deployment not found" error

- Verify you've created a deployment in Azure Studio
- Ensure the deployment name exactly matches the model name you're requesting
- Check that the deployment is in the same resource as your API key

### "Resource not found" error

- Verify the resource name is correct (check your Azure Portal endpoint URL)
- Ensure your API key belongs to the correct Azure resource
- Confirm the resource is in an active state in Azure Portal

### Rate limiting

- Azure has Tokens Per Minute (TPM) quotas per deployment
- Monitor usage in Azure Studio under **Quotas**
- Request quota increases through Azure Portal if needed for high-volume workloads

### Region availability

- Not all models are available in all Azure regions
- Check [Azure model availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability) for your region
- Consider creating resources in multiple regions for better availability
